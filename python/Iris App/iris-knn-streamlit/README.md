# Iris K-NN Classifier

This project is a web application built using Streamlit that classifies Iris flowers based on their measurements using the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. Users can input the sepal and petal dimensions of an Iris flower, and the application will predict the variety of the flower.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting flower measurements.
- Real-time prediction of Iris flower variety.
- Utilizes the K-NN algorithm for classification.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-knn-streamlit.git
   cd iris-knn-streamlit
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```
   streamlit run iris_knn_streamlit_app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

3. Use the sliders to input the sepal and petal measurements of the Iris flower.

4. Click on the "Predict" button to see the predicted flower variety.
